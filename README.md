# DashB

DashB allows a user to
- search through pre-installed Dash docs on any web browser of their choice
- use vi-bindings for super fast navigation.

### Ideal Usage (for complete keyboard based navigation):

- Use a separate browser window for DashB
- Pin DashB tab
- Use the extension Vimium for controlling everything using a keyboard, from scrolling to tab switching.
